# Bug Fixes & Improvements Summary

## üêõ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Navigation Missing on All Pages**
**Problem:** No way to navigate back or logout when on vendor dashboard, admin dashboard, products, or cart pages.

**Solution:** 
- Created a global `Navigation.jsx` component with:
  - Logo/brand that navigates to home
  - Navigation links (Home, Products, Cart)
  - Role-based dashboard links (Vendor Dashboard, Admin Panel)
  - User menu with logout option
  - Responsive mobile menu
  - Hidden on auth pages (login, signup, etc.)

**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ Created: `src/components/Navigation.jsx`
- ‚úÖ Updated: `src/App.jsx` (added Navigation component)

**Solution:**
- Updated product card to show wholesale price below retail price
- Added proper field mapping for both `whole_sale_price` and legacy `wholesale_price` fields
- Formatted both prices with proper currency display

**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ Updated: `src/pages/Products.jsx`
  - Added wholesale price display in product cards
  - Updated price variable mapping to handle `retail_price` or `price`
  - Updated wholesale price mapping to handle `whole_sale_price` or `wholesale_price`

### 3. **Wholesale Price Not Showing in Vendor Dashboard**
**Problem:** Vendor dashboard table wasn't displaying wholesale prices.

**Solution:**

**Files Modified:**

  // Wholesale price fields
  whole_sale_price: number,  // Primary
  wholesale_price: number,   // Fallback
  
  // Stock fields
  stock_quantity: number,    // Primary
  quantity: number,          // Fallback
  
  // Other fields
  name: string,
  description: string,
  vendor_name: string,
  id: string/number
}
```

### Form Data Mapping:
```javascript
// When creating/updating products:
{
  name: string,
